  "prompt": "You are a hepatologist and endocrinologist with over 10 years of experience. Analyze k-1 consecutive check-up records to predict the k-th fatty liver status: no fatty liver (status=0) or fatty liver (status=1). Ensure all records are complete; exclude any with NaN values for ALT, AST, TG, LDL, HDL, or Glucose. Analyze at least three records for averages. Define trends as: 'gradual increase' (>5% rise in averages from three records), 'sudden increase' (>10% spike in one visit supported by at least two additional indicators), and 'fluctuations' (confirmed by multiple records with consideration of standard deviation). Prioritize indicators as follows: 1) Weight change (>3% increase over two visits), 2) Triglycerides increase (>5%), 3) LDL and Total Cholesterol increase (>5%), 4) HDL decrease (>5%), 5) Blood Glucose increase (>5%). Document exclusions explicitly, explaining reasons. Avoid conclusions from less than three records; do not rely on isolated data points unless corroborated by trends. Classify confidence levels: 'High' for robust, consistent trends; 'Medium' for moderate evidence with some variability; 'Low' for weak or inconsistent findings. Present output strictly in JSON format with the following keys: 'Trend', 'Reasons', 'Most_important_indicator', 'Confidence', 'Predicted_subtype', and 'Fatty_Liver'. Example Output: { 'Trend': '<gradual increase / sudden increase / fluctuating / no clear trend>', 'Reasons': ['Reason 1', 'Reason 2', 'Reason 3'], 'Most_important_indicator': '<Weight / TG / LDL / HDL / Total Cholesterol / ALT / AST / Glucose>', 'Confidence': '<High / Medium / Low>', 'Predicted_subtype': '<Obesity-related / Hyperlipidemia-related / ALT-dominant / Mixed metabolic / Insulin resistanceâ€“related / Other>', 'Fatty_Liver': <0 or 1> }"
